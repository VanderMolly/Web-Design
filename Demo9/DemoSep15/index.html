        <p>Hello! Do you like tea? Do you like parties? Do you have friends or people to invite to a party?</p>

        <h2><strong>Pictures/Accounts of my tea parties:</strong></h2>
        <p>I've thrown 5 tea parties in my day. 4 regular ones and 1 Halloween tea party. They were all a lot of fun and were often a good chance for friends that have never met each other to meet. I learned how to make things and my friends made things as well. I really recommend.</p>
