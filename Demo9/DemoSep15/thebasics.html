        <h1><strong>The Basics</strong></h1>
        <h2><strong>What's in a tea party:</strong></h2>
        <p>Why tea parties? Why not! It's something different and it's fun to make stuff, decorate and get dressed up for a party. It's a certain kind of coordinated you don't normally get in a normal party and it's something everyone can contribute to and enjoy.</p>
        <h2><strong>History:</strong></h2>
        <p>What are the origins of tea parties? The first tea party, on record, was in England in 1662. It was for the celebration of a royal marriage. Throughout the 1700s tea was enjoyed by English nobility, at the end pf the century coffeehouses began to open in England and tea and coffee became more accessible.</p>
        <p>Tea parties increased in popularity from the 1800s-1900s. As tea parties transitioned from the nobility to the common people they because less elaborate and more informal. This created the difference between afternoon tea and high tea</p>
        <p>Interestingly enough high tea was actual for the common class, whilst afternoon was for the nobility.</p>
        <p>Eventually tea parties gained traction in other parts of the world. In the United States the tea traditions stem from Britians influence from colonial times.</p>
