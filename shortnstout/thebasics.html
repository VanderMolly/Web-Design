        <h2><strong>Why tea parties?</strong></h2>

It&rsquo;s fun and unique to put in the effort to plan a tea party, you can make invitations, get dressed up and make food. It&rsquo;s a cute activity you can do with your friends, can range from simple to elaborate and can be applied to many different occasions. Do something new and throw a tea party, you won&rsquo;t regret it!</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2><strong>History:</strong></h2>
        <p>The first recorded tea party was in England in 1662 to celebrate a royal marriage. Throughout the 1700s tea parties were enjoyed by English nobility. But towards the end of the century tea became more accessible with the rise of Coffeehouses.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Tea parties increased in popularity in the coming centuries. Eventually they grew among the common people and became less elaborate and more informal. This led to a distinction between &ldquo;afternoon tea&rdquo; and &ldquo;high tea&rdquo;. Although high tea was actually for the common class and afternoon was for the nobility.</p>
